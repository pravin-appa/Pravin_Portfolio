### [Project 1: Data Science Salary Estimator](https://github.com/pravin-appa/Salary-Estimator)
- Created a tool that estimates data science salaries to help data scientists negotiate their income when they get a job.
- Scraped over 1000 job descriptions from glassdoor using python and selenium
- Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel, aws, and spark. 
- Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model. 
- Built a client facing API using flask
  
### [Project 2:  Mobile Price Classification using AWS SageMaker](https://github.com/pravin-appa/Mobile-classification-using-Sagemaker-)

- Prepared and preprocessed data for model training.
- Created and fine-tuned a machine learning model using Python.
- Deployed the model on AWS SageMaker for real-time inference.

### [Project 3:  Research Paper Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Prompt](https://github.com/pravin-appa/LLM-pipeline)

- Developed and deployed a RAG prompt for research papers using LLM pipeline and Flask.
- Implemented a retrieval system to fetch relevant research papers and a generation model to summarize and provide insights.
- Deployed the application on Render for scalable web service access.

### [Project 4:  Algorithm Visualizer](https://github.com/pravin-appa/Algovisual)

- Designed and implemented an Algorithm Visualization project for sorting algorithms, including Quick Sort and Bubble Sort.
- Utilized C++ programming skills and Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL2) for creating and testing the algorithm.
- Demonstrated the ability to visualize complex algorithms to enhance understanding and facilitate testing.
